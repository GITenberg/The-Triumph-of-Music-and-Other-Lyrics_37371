<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lay in a vale 'twixt lone mountains<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A garden entangled with flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the whisper of echoing fountains<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stirred softly the musk-breathing bowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where torrents cast down from rock-masses,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From caverns of red-granite steeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thunders sonorous clove passes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And maddened dark gulfs with rash leaps,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It seemed that white spirits were sweeping<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Down, down thro' those voluble chasms,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wild weeping in resonant spasms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wave from the red-hearted granite<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In veins rolled tumbling around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meandered thro' shade-haunted forests<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where many rock barriers did span it<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To dash it in froth and in sound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the nights with their great moons could wan it,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">By shadows where murmurings kissed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here would I tarry to ponder<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the moon in blue vales made a mist;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dim in forests of rank, rocking cedars,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose wildness made glad with their scent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose boughs in the tempests were bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the pennons and plumes of fierce leaders,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And so when the moonshine was floating<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far up on the mountain's bleak head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the uttermost foam of the torrent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would I string a wild harp while was gloating<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The moon on my blossomy bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or I lay where a fountain of blossoms<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rained rustling from arches aloft,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the thick-scented arbors aloft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I sang as the blossoms' white bosoms<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pressed silk-smooth to mine and lay soft:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And laughed on my blossomy couch,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And he woke and cried out as if haunted:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Oh God! for one note of that song!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With fingers of lightness set sobbing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The chords of my harp in a song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I found that my heart was a-throbbing<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And he tost on the garment of satin<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His deep raven darkness of hair,<br /></span>

<h2>THE TROUBADOUR.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He stood where all the rare voluptuous West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some mad Maenad wine-stained to the breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot from delirious lips of ruby must<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long, fierce, triumphant smiles wherein hot lust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swam like a feverish wine exultant tost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High from a golden goblet and so lost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the West, and all the rosy West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bathed his frail beauty, hair and throat and breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there he bloomed, a thing of rose and snows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A passion flower of men of snows and rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the casement of her old red tower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat the lady sat, as white a flower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ever blew in Provence, and the lace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mist-like about her hair, half hid her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all its moods which his sweet singing raised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad moods that censured it, sweet moods that praised.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the white rose climbing over and over<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Up to her wide-flung lattice like a lover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gladiolas and deep fleurs-de-lis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held honey-cups up for the violent bee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within her garden by the ivied wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where many a fountain falling musical<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flamed fire-fierce in the eve against it flung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some mad nightingale the minstrel sung:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The passion, O! of plunging through and through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lascivious curls star-litten as light dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And jeweled thick, as is the bosomed dusk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dense scintillant with stars! Oh frenzy rare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of twisting curling fingers in thy hair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No touch of balm-beat winds from torrid seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were half so satin-soft in sorceries!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No god-like life so sweet as lost to lie<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Warm in the heart, like on a witch's glass<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No Siren sweetness wailed to lyres of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No naked beauty that the Greeks of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God-bosomed thro' the bursting foam did see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were potent, love, to tear mine eyes from thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Ah love, sweet love!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Far o'er the sea of old time once a witch,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Flung thro' the perfumed heav'ns of angel hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, linked in tangled labyrinths of bands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of soft rose-hearted flame and glimmer, rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One vast immensity of mazy gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sang, like some hurt creature desolate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heart-aching for the loss of some wild mate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hounded and speared to death of heartless men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In old romantic Arden waste; and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned to the one white star,&mdash;which like a stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of precious worth low on the heaven shone,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A white, sweet, lovely face and passed away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the warm flowers and the fountains' spray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that fair lady in pale drapery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High in the quaint, red tower, did she sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see him, dimming down the purple night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lone with his instrument die out of sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far in the rose-pleached, musk-drunk avenues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far in, far in amid the gleaming dews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, left alone but with the sighing rush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the wan fountains and the deep night hush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weep to the melancholy stars above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half the lorn night for the desired love?<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or down the rush-strewn halls, where arras old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Billowed with passage of her fold on fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even to the ponderous iron-studded gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shrieked with rust, steal from her lord and wait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the dingled hyacinth and rose<br /></span>

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
